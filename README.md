- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Github Pages - Deployed via Github Action

### What I learned

- In this simple project, I learned about creating and using CSS custom properties. I also learned how to use these custom properties using the _var()_ function in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Creating Color Themes With Custom Properties, HSL, and a Little calc()](https://css-tricks.com/creating-color-themes-with-custom-properties-hsl-and-a-little-calc/) - This helped me in creating CSS custom properties and how to use it.
